TV-Show-Renamer
===============

Background:
Before using media servers such as XBMC i had manually renamed all my media from common scrapable forms to the format '<Episode Number> - <Show Name>'
This program will rename all files back into the standard episode naming convention.

Future planned features:
    * .nfo generation from information from TV_db
    * renaming files to multiple different naming conventions
